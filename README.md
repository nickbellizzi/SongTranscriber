# Song Transcriber

## Motivation
Many students in linguistics or second language learners study the International Phonetic Alphabet ([IPA]), a system of phonetic notation used to detail the sounds of human language. Whether to study phonology or to just improve pronunciation of a target language, users can use this Android app to learn IPA in a fun and easy fashionâ€”listening to their favorite songs! When given song lyrics, this app produces a "lyric video" of sorts for learners to follow along; this has the added benefit of working as a mnemonic, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-does-music-aid-in-memorization-1388458293?tesla=y">as rhythm greatly assists memory.</a>

## How to use
Use of the app is explained [here].

## Tools
The [WordsAPI] was the principal addition used for this app, needed to facilitate the conversion from English to IPA. (Users should obtain an API key from [RapidAPI] to use.) Also used was [Volley], an HTTP library for making API requests.
